# Wine-Predictor

## Context
*Imagine you are working as a Data Scientist for an Online Wine Shop named “The Wine Land” 
*As the name suggests, the online store specializes in selling different varieties of wines.
*The online store receives a decent amount of traffic and reviews from its users.
*Leverage the “reviews” data and draw actionable insights from it.

## What is Expected?
*Build a predictive model for predicting the wine “variety”. Provide the output along with all features to a CSV file. Both Training & test data is provided here
*Submit the source code used for building models in a zip or share the link to the GitHub repository.
*Also submit a short summary: Model used, features extracted, Model accuracy in train. Along with some visualization of data and top 5 actionable Insights from the Data.

## The Data Description is as follows:
*user_name - user_name of the reviewer
*country -The country that the wine is from.
*review_title - The title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage.

*points - ratings given by the user. The ratings are between 0 -100.
*price - The cost for a bottle of the wine
*province - The province or state that the wine is from.
*region_1 - The wine-growing area in a province or state (ie Napa).
*region_2 - Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine-growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank.
*winery - The winery that made the wine
*variety - The type of grapes used to make the wine. Dependent variable for task 2 of the assignment
